My Components for TheMarketingLoom
This repository contains components I created for the TheMarketingLoom project, built with Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and Storyblok. All components are fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.

1. Sidebar Component
I developed the Sidebar Component for the TheMarketingLoom website. It is fully responsive and works smoothly, thanks to the use of useEffect for dynamic behavior.

!!! The Sidebar Component is the right bar on the homepage !!!

2. Artikel_Xs Component (Blok_Container)
The Artikel_Xs Component, positioned using the Blok_Container, displays three small articles side by side. The layout and spacing are managed for consistency and structure, ensuring full responsiveness across all devices.

!!! The Artikel_Xs component is under the Eyecatcher !!!

3. Tickets Component
The Tickets Component was created to display ticket details in a clean and structured layout. For simplicity and quick positioning, this component is hardcoded. Despite this, it remains fully responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.

!!! The Tickets Component is on the bottom off this page !!!
